This program requires python3 to be installed in the host computer

First download the folder, and install python. With the installation of python, all the packages used are shipped with python by default

After installing python, run the command, python3 hngHash.py

You will need a csv file in the same directory as that of this scripts.

For the input, use the filepath that look like this: 
c:/Users/Henry/Desktop/t/HNGi9 CSV FILE.csv for the csv file path and 
c:/Users/Henry/Desktop/t/sample(where the json files will be stored) for the json file path.

After the input above, the program will generate as many json files as present in the provided csv file and calculate sha256 for each json file. 
Then a new csv file containing all the data including our hash is generated in the current directory
